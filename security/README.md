1) For this assignment, I was able to find 4 security vulnerabilities in the code that was given to me. I was then able to write an HTML file containing my report on the security of the program I was tasked with testing.

2) For this assignment, I received some help from Drew Corlin, who was able to explain to me how to break down the code and expose vulnerabilities. I also offered some of my own knowledge to help Nick Camp with his assignment.

3) I spent roughly 7 hours on this assignment in total.
