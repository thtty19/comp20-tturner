  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>The product I tested is an app that saves and displays high scores that users
    get when playing 2048. The app recieves data from the 2048 game and writes
    it to a mongoDB database. When users visit the app, they can see all of the
    scores and when visiting /scores.json they can input a query string under
    username to see only scores for that username. I have been instructed to
    conduct penetration tests on the app. I am to find security flaws with the
    program and document them so that the overall security of the application
    can be improved.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h1>Methodology</h1>
  <p>First, I ran through the different aspects of the app as a user would. The
    first potential issue I noticed was the username input section. I then looked
    over the home screen and scores.json section of the application. After this,
    I read over the application's code to try to gain a better understanding of
    how the programs run. The first things I looked for were any places where the
    program uses user input. I found two different instances of user inputs. The
    first, when the user inputs their username after the game is finished. This
    is a prime opportunity for Cross Site Scripting (XSS) to occur. There
    were no programmed defenses for this section, so I tried inputing a basic
    javascript alert for the username. Upon visting the home page of the application,
    I was greeted by the alert I had input, signifying a vulnerability to XSS.
    The other user input is connected to the mongoDB database.
    This occurs when the user inputs the username they would like to see the scores
    for in the query string. This is a spot where a malicious user could gain
    access to the entire database by using NoSQL injection. Using Postman, this
    method was tested, demonstrating the vulnerability of the database to malicious
    requests. The third place I wanted to try was the submit page. Inherently, this
    page requires some type of submission, and using the right framework, can be
    exploited with NoSQL injections as well. Looking over the code, the submission
    was required to be in the x-www-form-urlencoded format. Using Postman again,
    I was succesfully able to inject data into the database. Through this method,
    I was even able to perform XSS, adding a user input pop-up window to the application
    upon loading.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
  <p> During my penetration testing, I found four major security issues. (Disclaimer: That does
    not mean my findings are the only security issues that may exist within the
    application). The first issue found was a XSS vulnerability from the game page
    itself. After the user finishes their game, they are prompted to enter their
    username. In this field, they can input javascript code that, if written correctly,
    will affect every user who visits the application's homepage. This can come in
    the form of pop-ups, redirections, or any other javascript functionality that
    currently exists. The second security issue found involved NoSQL injections
    from the scores.json page. The app requires the user to enter a query string
    into the url containing the username they are searching for. In this case, entering
    a "true" statement, such as "username[$ne]="a"" will pull up all the information
    for every username that is not "a". This provides hackers with access to all
    the data in the database, and can potentially expose sensitive information
    that could be stored on the database. The third issue uncovered is another
    NoSQL injection, this time from the /submit section of the app. Here, the game
    sends the required data to the database for storage. A third party
    could penetrate this system using simple computre science tools to input falsified
    data. The fourth issue is somewhat wrapped in with the third issue. From this
    NoSQL injection, a third party could again perfom XSS and add malicious code
    to the program, again interrupting and affecting every user who accesses the
    home page of the app.
  </p>

  <h1>Issues Found</h1>
  <h3>1) Cross Site Scripting from the Game</h3>
  <p>This issue arises on the game page for 2048. Specifically, it occurs when the
    user is prompted to input their username.
  </p>
  <p>This issue is a very severe issue. If a user is capable of inputing javascript
    code into the database, they can cause a wide variety of damage to every other
    user who access the main home page of the app itself.
  </p>
  <p>This issue involves inputing javascript code into a user input segment. When
    prompted, in this case for a username, the user can instead input the code.
    Anytime the program tries to use the username, it will run the javascript code
    that was input. For this app, that happens anytime the user goes to the homescreen.
    I found this problem by playing through the game, noticing the user input for
    the username, investigating the code to check for security around the input,
    and finally testing the issue.

    ensuing pop-up window at the home page.
