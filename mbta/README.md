1) I was able to implement all aspects of the project, but the amount of style and color I had time to add varied. There are areas where I could have done more formatting to provide a smoother or more visually appealing interface.

2) I received some help from Nick Camp in getting the geolocation services to function properly

3) I spent approximately 20 hours on this assignment, much of it spent in frustration because I could not solve inhibitory issues, such as the .getCurrentPosition causing a 404 error. Once I finally found solutions, the majority of the project was not as time consuming.
