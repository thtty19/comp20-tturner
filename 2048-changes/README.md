1) I was able to set up a heroku app with a database. I was also able to understand some of the game code to determine when the game was over and what the values wanted were saved as. I was not able to get a secure connection between the database and the game files. My code stopped updating after I saved it at one point, and that made it difficult to continue working on my assignment. I really struggled with this assignment all around.

2) I spent roughly 15 hours on this assignment.

3) I received a little help from Sam Hollingsworth, but he did not remember much of what to do.
