I implemented all the desired parts of the lab. I spent a majority of the time trying to determine the correct syntax for setting a background image and then sizing the windows correctly for each panel of the comic.

I received help with the syntax of setting background images from a former Comp 20 student, Ryan Magnuson.

I spent roughly 90 minutes on this lab.
