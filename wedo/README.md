For this assignment, I was able to make the text change depending on where in the video the user is. I as also able to add some styling to the webpage to make the page better fit the theme of the video. I have had some trouble trying to find the correct width for the boxes that contain the words and the lyrics, because I don't want to cover too much of the background unnecessarily. I opted to use the view width parameters to ensure that the user can always see some of the background image.

I received help from Sam Hollingsworth, a friend who has previously taken the class. He helped to shore up my understanding of javascript and event listeners.

The assignment took me approximately 3 hours to complete, much of that time being spent trying to figure out javascript, before Sam helped me.
