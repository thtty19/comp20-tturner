Lab 9: Self Evaluation
1) This Git repository acted as an external back up for all of my work. It also served as a location where Ming could easily see when our work was updated, and when issues arose, be able to read our code without having to access our computer. It also helped teach us about version control.

2) The MBTA assignment was my favorite. I liked it because I had fun learning javascript and also because I though the actual product delivered was interesting and useful.

3) I think that in terms of web development, I have grown somewhat since the start of this course. I now understand the different levels required to operate a fully functional website. I also think I have become more proficient at googling answers to issues I am having.

4) I think the most important thing I learned was javascript. Last semester I had to make a website for a class to show my work, and I really struggled to produce a website that wasn't aesthetically atrocious and hard to follow. This year, I have to make another website for my senior design project to keep track of our progress and show our results, and with Javascript I have been able to add functionality and usability without the hassle I endured last year.

5) I would like to keep learning more javascript.
